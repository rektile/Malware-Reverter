# Malware Watcher
This program takes snapshots before and after the execution of "malware." It displays newly added programs to the autorun list and any alterations to Windows Defender registry keys. It is not meant to replace an antivirus but rather to serve as an additional research tool.

## Installation
Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rektile/Malware-Watcher.git
```

Go into the folder
```shell
cd ./Malware-Watcher
```

Install python requirements
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Take snapshots
1. Run Main.py or MalwareWatcher.exe with admin privileges.
2. Wait till the first snapshot has been taken.
3. Run the "malware" and wait till it finishes
4. Press enter to take the second snapshot
5. You can find the logs in `./output` and the changes file in `./change`

### Revert changes to registry
You can revert the changes made to the registry by using the .changes file that has been created.

```
